# Blog-site-with-comment-section
This project, Blog Site with Comment Section, is a simple and interactive web application designed to allow users to create blog posts, view them, and share their thoughts through comments. The site provides a smooth and dynamic commenting experience, where comments appear instantly after submission without reloading the page. It demonstrates the complete user flow, including post creation, display, and comment management, with basic protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through input sanitization. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a clean and responsive design that works well across devices. It serves as a beginner-friendly model for understanding blog architecture, user interaction, and dynamic content rendering in web development.
